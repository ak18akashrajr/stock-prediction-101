# Stock Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting stock prices using machine learning techniques. It utilizes historical stock data, processes it, and applies predictive models to forecast future stock movements.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Time series analysis
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Stock price forecasting
- Visualization of predictions

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy (Data processing)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)
- Scikit-Learn (Machine learning models)
- TensorFlow/Keras (Deep learning models, if applicable)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-prediction-101.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd stock-prediction
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage
- Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Stock-Prediction.ipynb`).
- Load a stock dataset (ensure the CSV file is in the correct format).
- Run the notebook cells sequentially.
- Analyze and visualize stock predictions.

## Dataset
- The project requires historical stock price data in CSV format.
- Ensure the dataset includes columns like `Date`, `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Volume`.

## Model Performance
- The project evaluates models based on metrics such as:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R-Squared Score
